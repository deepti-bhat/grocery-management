Grocery Management System for Vendors and Customers using C++

This project caters to the needs of both vendors and customers when it comes to orderig groceries. Using only C++, the program is designed to enable vendors to:
<ul>
  <li>Create New Categories (like adding a new bakery section!)</li>
  <li>Add New Products</li>
  <li>View Products in Categories</li>
  <li>Delete Products</li>
  <li>Update Stock & Prices</li>
</ul>

Additionally, the customers are able to:<br>
<ul>
  <li>View Available Categories</li>
  <li>Add Items to Cart</li>
  <li>Remove Items from Cart</li>
  <li>Checkout with Bill Generation</li>
</ul>
